## Inspiration
Create an innovative group chat that avoids unnecessary messages we are not interested in.
We wanted to create something new and bring the "classical" chatting experience to the next level.
Normally, group chats make it really hard to change groups or message less people inside a group, creating a lot of unnecessary spam.

## What it does
It creates a new, easy-to-use group chat that allows you to change in every moment the people you're connecting with.
Only the people you choose will receive you're messages, there is no need to create a group just for a single message. You can login, add your friends, change your profile picture and, obviously, instantly chat and connect with other people. 
Also, regarding privacy and security, it uses end-to-end encryption so that only your intended recipient and nobody else can read your messages. 
Your conversation won't be spied upon ever again!

## How we built it
We used NodeJS as our back-end together with MongoDB to provide storage for our application. On the front-end we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for ease of accessibility. This allowed us to have a more unified stack, thus more hassle free development. We made great of the APIs presented at the Hackathon. For real-time message notifications we used Pusher and MessageBird for SMS reminders about unread messages.

## Challenges we ran into
Create an original and at the same time easy-to-use user interface, trying to make their experience as positive as possible.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a full functional web application from scratch, throughout the troubles that we faced and solve.
A project that sometime could be really useful to some people.

## What we learned
Stay awake for 24h. 
Learned how NOT to use GitHub and, later on, maybe how to use it properly.
That great teamwork can create awesome projects.

## What's next for Mymos
Make our features easier-to-use and improve our UI.
